# Redis Basics

## Project Overview
This project explores the basics of using Redis as a data storage and caching system in Python. It demonstrates how to perform basic operations with Redis and use it as a simple cache. The project requirements include creating Python files that are compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and follow the `pycodestyle` (v2.5) guidelines.

## Learning Objectives
1. Perform basic operations using Redis.
2. Use Redis as a simple caching solution.

## Requirements
- **OS:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Python Version:** 3.7
- **Code Style:** Pycodestyle 2.5
- All files should end with a new line and have a `README.md` at the root of the folder.
- Documentation required for modules, classes, functions, and methods.
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
